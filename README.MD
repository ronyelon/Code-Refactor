The need in this project was to refactor the existing code so that it meets the criteria requested by the client:
    GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
    HEN I view the source code
    THEN I find semantic HTML elements
    WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
    THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
    WHEN I view the image elements
    THEN I find accessible alt attributes
    WHEN I view the heading attributes
    THEN they fall in sequential order
    WHEN I view the title element
    THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

This project involved updating the HTML and CSS files to:
    Add Alt text for images for the purpose of complying with accessibility and search engine optimization standards
    Removed repetitive code
    Reorganized CSS so it matches HTML code structure
