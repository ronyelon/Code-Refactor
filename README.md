The need in this project was to refactor existing code to meet the criteria set by the client:
  GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
  WHEN I view the source code
  THEN I find semantic HTML elements
  WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
  THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
  WHEN I view the image elements
  THEN I find accessible alt attributes
  WHEN I view the heading attributes
  THEN they fall in sequential order
  WHEN I view the title element
  THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

Actions taken:
    Application's links all function correctly.
    Alt and title text for all images updated for purpose of complying with accessbility and search engine optimization standards.
    Application's CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure.
    Application's CSS file is properly commented.
